"""A while loop performs an operation while a certain condition is true. Use a while loop to:
Check for another line in a file.
Check if a flag has been set.
Check if a user has finished entering values.
Check if something else has changed to indicate that the code can stop performing the operation
-Ensure the condition changes, if it's always true Python will run the code until the program crashes
